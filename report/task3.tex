\Problem{
Implement a Python function \texttt{state\_probability(pi, A, s, t)} that takes 
initial state distribution $\pi$, transition matrix $A$, state $s$ and time $t$ 
and outputs the probability of state $s$ at time $t$. You can assume that the 
set of state is $S=\{0,1,\dots,N-1\}$. \\
You can use file \texttt{ex3.py} provided online.
}

\Solution{
	
	\begin{python}
import numpy as np

def state_probability(pi, A, s, T):
	prob = np.array(pi)
	for i in range(T):
		prob = np.matmul(prob, A)
	return prob[s]
	\end{python}
