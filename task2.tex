\Problem{Your friend has two urns, labelled 1 and 2. Urn 1 contains 5 blue, 2 
red and 4 yellow balls. Urn two contains 3 blue, 4 red and 3 yellow balls. She 
covers your eyes with a tape. Then, she chooses one urn at random with equal 
probability. You pick one ball from that urn, she tells you its colour and then 
you return the ball to the urn you picked it from (you donâ€™t know which one as 
your eyes are covered). Your friend switches from urn 1 to urn 2 with 
probability 1/2 and from urn 2 to urn 1 with probability 3/4. You pick one ball 
again, she tells you its colour and the process repeats.

\begin{itemize}
	\item[(a)] Describe the system as hidden Markov model. What are $S, O, \pi, 
	A, B$?
	\item[(b)] What is the probability that initial urn was urn 1, then urn 2 
	and urn 1 again given that you picked yellow, red and blue balls 
	respectively. Use dynamic programming!
	\item[(c)] What is the most probable sequence of urns given that you picked 
	red, yellow and blue. Use Viterbi algorithm!
\end{itemize}
}

\Solution{
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[(a)] 
		\item[(b)] 
		\item[(c)] 
	\end{itemize}
