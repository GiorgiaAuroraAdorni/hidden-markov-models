\Problem{
Implement a Python function \texttt{state\_probability(pi, A, s, t)} that takes 
initial state distribution $\pi$, transition matrix $A$, state $s$ and time $t$ 
and outputs the probability of state $s$ at time $t$. You can assume that the 
set of state is $S=\{0,1,\dots,N-1\}$. Hint: your code should contain two for 
loops.
